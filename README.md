# OpenWeather API usage #

The "Weather-API" repository contains a simple implementation of a weather API that retrieves current weather data for a specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The code is written in Python and uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather data in JSON format. The repository includes a main Python file that contains the implementation of the weather API, as well as a requirements file that lists the dependencies needed to run the code.

The implementation allows users to input a city name and a country code to retrieve the current weather data for that location, including information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The implementation is straightforward and easy to use, making it a useful tool for those looking to quickly retrieve weather data for a given location.
